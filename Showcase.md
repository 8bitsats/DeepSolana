This new realm of possibility and infrastructure on Solana, showcases decentralized AI inference and training on chain! It is basically Blockchain-Powered AI Playground on chain.

Features: 

Live Inference Chat: Users input text → model generates responses (using Solana for request/result tracking).

Model Version Control: Show current model version stored on IPFS/Arweave, with CID displayed on-chain.

Training Contribution: Users "stake" mock SOL to vote on training directions (e.g., "Improve code generation").

3D Blockchain Visualization: Animated Solana blockchain network in the background showing data flow.

Tech Stack:


Frontend: React.js + Three.js (3D visuals) + Tailwind CSS

Blockchain: Solana Web3.js + Phantom Wallet

AI: Hugging Face Transformers.js (for inference simulation)

Tools: 

Decentralized Storage: IPFS, Arweave.

Compute: Akash Network, Golem, Fluence.

Solana Tools: Anchor Framework, Solana Web3.js.

ML Tools: Hugging Face Transformers.js, ONNX Runtime.

The architecture balances Solana’s strengths (coordination, payments, and state management) with off-chain decentralized infrastructure for heavy lifting.
