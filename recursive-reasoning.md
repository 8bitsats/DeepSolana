# Recursive Reasoning

## Recursive Reasoning and ZK Compression

This project implements recursive reasoning and zero-knowledge proof compression for the Solana blockchain using deep learning techniques.

```

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Train the model:

```bash
python train_solana_model.py
```

3. Monitor training progress:

* Model checkpoints are saved in `model_artifacts/weights/`
* Training logs are available in `model_artifacts/logs/`
* Metrics are tracked in `model_artifacts/metrics/`

### Using the Model

#### Compress ZK Proofs

```python
from scripts.use_model import SolanaZKCompressor

# Initialize compressor with trained model
compressor = SolanaZKCompressor("./solana-model")

# Compress a proof
proof_data = {...}  # Your ZK proof data
compressed = compressor.compress_proof(proof_data)
```

#### Model Features

1. **Recursive Compression**
   * Multi-layer compression for optimal size reduction
   * Configurable recursion depth
   * Automatic validation of compressed proofs
2. **Training Tracking**
   * Checkpoint saving and loading
   * Performance metrics logging
   * Training progress visualization
3. **Configuration**
   * Adjustable compression parameters
   * Model hyperparameter tuning
   * Hardware optimization settings

### Research

See `Docs/DeepSolanaRecursiveReasoning.md` for detailed information about:

* Theoretical framework
* Implementation details
* Performance analysis
* Applications and use cases

### Model Architecture

The model uses a GPT-2 based architecture with:

* Causal language modeling
* Recursive proof compression
* Zero-knowledge optimization

Key configurations can be adjusted in `config/model_config.json`.
